# Sudoku solver

Idea:

1. Read an image file / take an image.
2. Detect the sudoku within.
3. Solve the sudoku.
4. Render the solution into the image.

Current problems:

- Sudoku detection is not complete
- Digit classifier can be trained on MNIST but there is no input normalization therefore the classifier does not work.
- Hardcoded paths
- No sudoku solver
- Probably a lot more
